# alien-hunt-text-adventure
A branching text-based adventure game built during Day 3 of the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp. You’ve crash-landed on an alien planet, and your choices will determine if you survive, perish… or find the alien who can help you escape. This was a fun exercise to practice conditional logic and nested if-statements.
