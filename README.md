# Alien Hunt â€“ Day 3 of the 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp

This project was built as part of Day 3 of the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp. The original challenge was a treasure hunt, but I reimagined it as a **sci-fi adventure** for a creative twist.

## ðŸ‘½ Story

You've crash-landed on a mysterious alien planet. Your mission: find the alien who can help you get home. Along the way, you must choose your path carefullyâ€”navigate a crater, face a dark cave, and finally select one of three mysterious gems. Choose wisely.

### Hint:
The correct gem is **green**, a nod to the classic alien trope.

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Nested `if` / `else` conditional logic
- Using `or` operators to reduce code repetition
- Handling invalid inputs with defensive programming
- Creative storytelling through code

## ðŸ›  Improvements I Made

- Transformed the original treasure hunt theme into a sci-fi alien encounter.
- Used `or` logic to consolidate repeated `"Game over."` messages and simplify condition checks.
- Added custom error messages for invalid inputs to enhance user feedback and immersion.

Thanks for checking out my project. More to come as I progress through the bootcamp!
